=== This template file contains questions you need to answer.
=== Fill your answers on appropriate blank lines only.
=== Don't start any line with three equal signs "===".
=== Don't edit any lines starting from three equal signs.
=== Use C notation to write numbers: 42 for decimal, 0x2a for hexadecimal.
=== We may check most of the answers automatically, so "forty two" or
=== "26+16" won't work for this example. Spaces are mostly ignored, so
=== "  42  " is OK (without quotes of course). 
=== When asked to specify address & instruction, do it in the form of
=== gdb output "ADDRESS: INSTRUCTION", for example "0x7c26:  or  $0x1,%eax"
=== Don't make lines longer than 80 characters. You don't need to fit your
=== answer in a single line, you can start a new line at will.
=== However, when asked to fill "a table" make each table raw a single line.


=== Q What's the purpose of leaving virtual memory region
===   0xeebfe000-0xeec00000 inaccessible?
===   (free form, up to 10 words)
???

=== Q What's the value of vpd global variable?
effbf000 , as found in obj/kern/kernel.sym.
Also, we can see how it is calculated in entry.S:80, 
using the formula (VPT + SRL(VPT, 10)), while
SRL(VPT, 10) => ((VPT) >> (10)) & ~(-1 << (32 - (10))),
and VPT = efc00000 (also found in kernel.sym).

=== Q Consider virtual address V=0xeffbfefc which is mapped to some
===   physical address P. Assume TLB is empty and kernel performs read
===   from V. How many times P is accessed? Hint: V is not an arbitrary
===   address.

=== Q Denote your answer to the previous question as X. Imagine that
===   we've asked the same question for some V2 and the answer was X2. If
===   it's possible that X2>X, write an example V2, otherwise, write "NO".
===   For example, if your previous answer is 100, for which V2 the
===   answer could be 101 or greater?

=== Q What's the size (in bytes) of pp_link entry in struct Page?

=== Q Define a segment descriptor with the following properties:
===   segment present in memory, spans 0x12345600-0x3579c5ff (linear)
===   addresses and intended to be used by application. All bits which
===   are not responsible for above properties are set to zero. 
===   (in the form WORD1 WORD2 as would be output by gdb's x/2x)


=== Q Define a page table entry with the following properties:
===   frame starts at 0x1234000. It can be written by the kernel
===   without causing any errors, but has never been written yet. On
===   the other hand, application cannot write to the page, but has
===   recently successfully read from it. All bits which are not
===   responsible for above properties are set to zero.  
===   (a single memory WORD as would be output by gdb's x/1x)

=== Q Consider JOS kernel code:
===     mystery_t x;
===   	char* value = return_a_pointer();
===   	*value = 10;
===   	x = (mystery_t) value;
===   What type mystery_t should refer to?
===   (remove leading "====" from the correct answer line)
==== uintptr_t
==== physaddr_t


=== Q What information is stored in page directory when i386_vm_init()
===   finishes? For each non-empty PD entry specify:
===    - decimal index (0-1023)
===    - hexadecimal address of virtual memory mapped by this entry
===    - name of kernel data structure which is intended to be
===      accessible through this PDE (when appropriate, in quotes)
===    - general name (free form, up to 10 words in quotes)
===    Sort the table by the index in ascending order. If several
===    consequent entries are only differ in address field, you can
===    specify ellipses ("...") instead of an "inner" entries. Please
===    align columns into readable table using spaces.
===    Format example (all the values are made up; omit the header):
===    INDEX ADDRESS DATA-STRUCTURE         NAME/DESCRIPTION
===    24    0x12345 "struct Segdesc gdt[]" "Global descriptor table"
===    ...
===    42    0x98765 "struct Segdesc gdt[]" "Global descriptor table"
===    50    0x00011 ""                     "boot loader code"

=== Q What is the first instruction which would be "broken" if
===   i386_vm_init() wouldn't remap PDE 0? (address & instruction)

=== Q Can this instruction be "fixed" (i.e. replaced by another
===   instruction which would produce the desired effect)?
===   If yes, write the "fixed" instruction, otherwise write NO.

=== Q Propose two ways to change i386_vm_init() (or other places) to
===   support JOS kernel bigger than 4MB.

===   Way 1 (free form, up to 40 words, don't need to use all 40!)

===   Way 2 (free form, up to 40 words, don't need to use all 40!)

=== Q Which virtual addresses are readable by the user?
===   (in the form ADDR1-ADDR2, if none, specify NONE)

=== Q Which virtual addresses are writable by the user?
===   (in the form ADDR1-ADDR2, if none, specify NONE)

=== Q Assume a hacker can change N bits inside page table (on any
===   level, PD or PT) after it has been set up by the kernel (and
===   before full TLB flush). What is the minimal N to gain full
===   control of the system from hacker's user space process?

=== Q What's the maximum amount of physical memory this kernel can
===   support? (number of megabytes, without MB suffix)

=== Q What single constant can be changed in kernel source to make
===   this limit 2 times lower (if kernel normally supports 10MB,
===   we want to make it support only 5MB?

=== Q What value should this constant be changed to?

=== Q Assume the computer has the maximum amount of memory supported
===   by the (unmodified) kernel. What's the overhead of managing this
===   memory in terms of (physical) memory spent?
===   Specify only data structures which size depends on the amount of
===   physical memory and exclude the "fixed" overhead. For example,
===   if data structure size is 123K+0.01*(memory size) and maximum 
===   amount of memory is 100MB, specify 0.01*100MB = 1024KB.
===   For each such data structure specify:
===    - size in KB (without "KB suffix")
===    - name of kernel data structure (when appropriate, in quotes)
===    - general name (free form, up to 10 words in quotes)
===    Sort the table by the size in ascending order. Please
===    align columns into readable table using spaces.
===    Format example (all the values are made up; omit the header):
===    SIZE  DATA-STRUCTURE         NAME/DESCRIPTION
===    42    "struct Segdesc gdt[]" "Global descriptor table"

====================================================================
=== Q What challenge(s) have you chosen to implement? (specify
===   challenge numbers separated by spaces, if more than one)

=== Q If the challenge requires changing the kernel source, list the
===   files which you have changed/added during implementation.
===   (one file per line, relative to lab directory containing .git/)

=== Q Describe you solution.
===   (free form, up to 500 words, don't need to use all 500!)
